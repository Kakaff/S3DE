# S3DE

Simple 3D Engine

A simple 3D engine written in C# and OpenGL, using OpenGL.Net and GLFW.Net

Currently in the early stages and does not yet render anything.

Planned features:
Customizable renderer, support for any graphics API. (Well on the way, OpenGL sample being worked on).
Customizable physics.
Lightweight, robust and easy to use.

Taking inspiration from unity the Entity-Component system is very similar.
